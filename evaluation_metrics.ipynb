    "1. If you're working on an established problem, then you'll feel pressure from readers (and referees) to use the metrics that have already been used for the problem. This might be a compelling pressure. However, you should always feel free to argue against those cultural norms and motivate new ones. Areas can stagnate due to poor metrics, so we must be vigilant!\n",

    "With precision–recall curves, we get a generalized perspective on F1 scores (and we could weight precision and recall differently to achieve the effects of `beta` for F scores more generally). These curves can be used, not only to assess a system, but also to identify an optimal decision boundary given external goals.    \n",

    "* Most implementations are limited to binary problems. The basic concepts are defined for multi-class problems, but it's very difficult to understand the resulting hyperplanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no single statistic that does justice to the full curve, so this metric isn't useful on its own for guiding development and optimization. Indeed, opening up the decision threshold in this way really creates another hyperparameter that one has to worry about!\n",
